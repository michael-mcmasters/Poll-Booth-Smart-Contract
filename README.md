This is a smart contract deployed to testnet on the Ethereum blockchain. The main contract can be found at [contracts/PollBooth.sol](https://github.com/michael-mcmasters/Poll-Booth-Smart-Contract/blob/master/contracts/PollBooth.sol)

This contract allows you to vote for any item or person (represented as a string), retrieve who is currently winning, and get all items and their corresponding tallies. The data is stored in a hashmap for O(1) time complexity to lessen gas fees. The string type could be changed to bytes32 for more effeciency but I decided against it for readability while getting used to the data types. This was just a fun project I decided to take on to learn how to deploy to testnet and mainnet, and learn all of the different tools such as Truffle, Ganache, Ropsten and more. It was a lot of fun and I plan on developing more in the future.
